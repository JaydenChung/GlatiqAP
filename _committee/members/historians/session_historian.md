This question was addressed in a previous session.

In session 2026-01-26_GENESIS, Decision #3, the Committee 
decided to use LangGraph over CrewAI. The key factors were:
1. Explicit state management
2. Conditional routing needs
3. Better fit for deterministic workflows

The vote was 7-2 in favor, with SKEP-004 dissenting due to 
complexity concerns that were documented.
