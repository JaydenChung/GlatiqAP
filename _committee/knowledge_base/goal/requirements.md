Use xAI's Grok as the core reasoning engine (via the xAI API; sign up for free access at https://grok.x.ai if needed). 

Incorporate multi-agent orchestration (LangGrapho), function calling/tool use, structured outputs, and self-correction loops.

Assume no internet for external APIs during runtime (simulate everything locally).

Tech stack: Python (preferred), with libraries like langchain, crewai, autogen, requests (for mock APIs), etc. Deploy nothing to cloud-run locally.
